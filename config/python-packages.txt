# Python packages for ghcr.io/hypertidy/gdal-r-python image
# Core geo stack aligned to GDAL
#
# CRITICAL: DO NOT ADD 'GDAL' HERE
# The osgeo.gdal bindings come from the GDAL build itself (in osgeo/gdal image).
# pip installing GDAL would install a DIFFERENT version that doesn't match.
#
# Packages that link GDAL/PROJ/GEOS are installed with --no-binary to ensure
# they compile against our system libraries (see Dockerfile).

# Core geo stack - these link GDAL/PROJ/GEOS

# These use the above under the hood (no direct GDAL linkage)
